# ðŸ§  MIMIC-III Exploratory Data Analysis

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores the **MIMIC-III** clinical database, a large, de-identified dataset containing health-related data from intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
The goal is to **analyze and understand the structure, diversity, and challenges** of real-world medical data prior to applying any predictive modeling.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on selected MIMIC-III tables.
* Investigate patient demographics, ICU stay durations, diagnoses, and outcomes.
* Discuss the complexity, sparsity, and ethical constraints of medical datasets.

### ðŸ§© Conclusion

This exploratory analysis highlighted the inherent challenges of working with the MIMIC-III clinical dataset, even on a small subset.
The available data proved insufficient to capture the full diversity of real-world clinical scenarios and removing rows with missing values further reduced the usable sample size, making statistical exploration difficult.
Despite focusing on a few basic attributes (such as admission/discharge dates, birth and death dates), the datasetâ€™s sparsity and irregularity became evident. Moreover, interpreting fields like diagnosis required medical domain expertise as textual and coded clinical information are often ambiguous without clinical context.
Overall, this work demonstrates that medical data is complex, incomplete and context-dependent, emphasizing the importance of domain collaboration and careful preprocessing before applying any AI or statistical modeling.

Before this analysis, I had worked with biophysical (TFM) and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and observed how challenging they were to interpret without specialized biological knowledge.
Exploring MIMIC-III confirmed that this difficulty is not limited to molecular or cellular data, even clinical datasets at the patient level present similar barriers.
In all these contexts, data complexity, missing information and the need for domain expertise make the analysis nontrivial and highlight why collaboration between data scientists and medical experts is essential to extract meaningful insights from biomedical data.
